**Abstract:**

Protein function prediction is critical for understanding the cellular physiological and biochemical processes, and it opens up new possibilities for advancements in fields such as disease research and drug discovery. During the past decades, with the exponential growth of protein sequence data, many computational methods for predicting protein function have been proposed. Therefore, a systematic review and comparison of these methods are necessary. In this study, we divide these methods into four different categories, including sequence-based methods, 3D structure-based methods, PPI network-based methods and hybrid information-based methods. Furthermore, their advantages and disadvantages are discussed, and then their performance is comprehensively evaluated and compared. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities present in this field.
