**Abstract:**

As structure prediction methods are generating millions of publicly available protein structures, searching these databases is becoming a bottleneck. Foldseek aligns the structure of a query protein against a database by describing tertiary amino acid interactions within proteins as sequences over a structural alphabet. Foldseek decreases computation times by four to five orders of magnitude with 86%, 88% and 133% of the sensitivities of Dali, TM-align and CE, respectively.

**Availability and implementation:** https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek and https://search.foldseek.com/
